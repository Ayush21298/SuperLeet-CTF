# Project Description

There are 3 [`apps`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/applications/) in this _Django_ `project`.
- _`questionnaire`_: This app will handle the part of the contest consisting of questions (normal or MCQ-type).
- _`jeopardyctf`_: This app will handle the _jeopardy style CTF_ contests.
- _`accounts`_: This app concerns with user profiles.
- _`allauth`_: This is the app we're using for authentication, with social logins.

We're using [_`django-allauth`_](https://www.intenct.nl/projects/django-allauth/) for authentication. _GitHub_, _Google_, and _Facebook_ has been added as '_social login_' providers.
To explore it, visit the routes:
- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/signup/`
- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/login/`
- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/logout/`

### _`addquestions`_ command

There is an `addquestions` command, which adds question from an input `JSON` file to the _database_. This will hopefully make adding new questions a robust process.

Below is an example run of the `addquestions` command.
```
Î» python manage.py addquestions
Successfully added questions to DB from 'questionnaire/questions/questions.json'
```

By default is assumes the input `JSON` file is `questionnaire/questions/questions.json`.
